# Low-rank simulations

This repo contains simulations to check the low-rank approximation of conditional probabilities in the dynamic network model.

The repo contains several folders:

- `code`: contains all code to run the simulations
- `output`: simulation output is saved and stored here
- `notes`: latex notes (includes graphs and tables)
